# tsp-streamlit-dashboard
This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that demonstrates and compares multiple algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Users can input locations manually or via search, choose optimization algorithms, and visually track the progress and performance of each method over time.
